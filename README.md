# Sigil Siege

![Screenshot of game play](/screenshots/board-progress.png)

Created for [Bevy game jam #3](https://itch.io/jam/bevy-jam-3). [Play on itch.io](https://displacelobster.itch.io/sigil-siege).

Play a random deck of cards with sigils representing different side affects against an opponent. Just be wary that those sigils that have been given will also be removed if the card leaves the board. The goal is to raze your opponent's tower before they wipe out your health.

Choose a deck size of small, medium, or large to play with more cards but also against an opponent with a larger tower! You will not be granted additional health...

The game is played completely with a mouse.

1. Select a deck size and click "Play" to start.
1. Each turn you have a set amount of "power" to spend to play cards. This will increase to a maximum as the game progresses.
1. Select cards that you have the power to play and select a corresponding empty placement on the board to play them.
1. When you are done playing cards, select the dial (with the arrow) to end your turn.
1. Cards automatically attack across on turn end and will attack the enemy tower if there are no cards present.

Your enemy has the same abilities and limitations as you except they lack your acumen for strategy... so they have been granted a better selection to play from... Good luck!
